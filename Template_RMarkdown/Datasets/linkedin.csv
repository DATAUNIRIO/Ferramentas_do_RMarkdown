48,Vincent Granville,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentg/,"Washington, United States","Data science pioneer, founder, author, patent owner, CEO, investor, with broad spectrum of domain expertise, technical knowledge, and proven success in bringing measurable added value to companies ranging from startups to fortune 100, across multiple industries (finance, Internet, media, IT, security) and domains (data science, operations research, machine learning, AI, computer science, business intelligence, IoT). Vincent developed and deployed new techniques such as hidden decision trees (for scoring and fraud detection), automated tagging, indexing and clustering of large document repositories, black-box, scalable, simple, noise-resistant regression known as the Jackknife Regression (fit for real-time or automated data processing), model-free confidence intervals, combinatorial feature selection algorithms, detecting causation not correlations, and generally speaking, the invention of a set of consistent robust statistical / machine learning techniques that can be understood, implemented, interpreted, leveraged and fine-tuned by the non-expert. Vincent also invented many synthetic metrics that work better than old-fashioned stats, especially on badly-behaved sparse big data. Some of these techniques have been implemented in a Map-Reduce Hadoop-like environment. Some are concerned with identifying true signal in an ocean of noisy data. Vincent is a former post-doctorate of Cambridge University and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. He created the first IoT platform to automate growth and content generation for digital publishers, using a system of API's for machine-to-machine communications, involving Hootsuite, Twitter, and Google Analytics. Vincent's profile is accessible at https://dsc.news/2GdAtR1 and includes top publications, presentations, and work experience with Visa, Microsoft, eBay, NBC, Wells Fargo, and other organisations.",Analytics|Data Mining|Big Data
