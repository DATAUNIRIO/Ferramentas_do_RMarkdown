## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,eval=FALSE}

#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,comment = NA)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
# devtools::install_github("djnavarro/bs4cards")
library(bs4cards)
kitties_with_footers <- list(
  card(
  title = "A kitten card",
  image = "https://placekitten.com/300/200",
  text = "The image at the top of this card is from placekitten.com. It's very cute",
  header = "Header",
  footer = "Kitten A"),
  card(
  title = "A kitten card",
  image = "https://placekitten.com/300/200",
  text = "The image at the top of this card is from placekitten.com. It's very cute",
  header = "Header",footer = "Kitten B"), 
  sample_card(footer = "Kitten C")
) 
card_grid(kitties_with_footers)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(bs4cards)
slides <- list(
  
  card(
    title = "Starting R markdown",
    image = "https://slides.djnavarro.net/index_img/starting-rmarkdown.png",
    link = "https://slides.djnavarro.net/starting-rmarkdown",
    text = "An introduction to R markdown. The target audience is a novice R user with no previous experience with markdown."
  ),
  
  card(
    title = "Starting ggplot2",
    image = "https://slides.djnavarro.net/index_img/starting-ggplot2.png",
    link = "https://slides.djnavarro.net/starting-ggplot2",
    text = "An introduction to ggplot2. The target audience is a novice user with no previous experience with R or ggplot2."
  ),
  
  card(
    title = "Starting programming",
    image = "https://slides.djnavarro.net/index_img/starting-programming.png",
    link = "https://slides.djnavarro.net/starting-programming",
    text = "This is primarily a tutorial on making generative art in R, but in doing so introduces core programming constructs and data structures. It is assumed the user has some previous experience with ggplot2."
  )
)
card_grid(slides)
```

The goal of bs4cards is to make this task a little easier inside an R markdown document or website.
