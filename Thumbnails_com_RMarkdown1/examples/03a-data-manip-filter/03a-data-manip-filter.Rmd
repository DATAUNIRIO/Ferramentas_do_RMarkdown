## Welcome

### `r ""`

Visualisation is an important tool for generating insights, but your data won't always arrive ready to visualize. Often you'll need to filter unwanted observations from your data or create new variables and summaries to visualize. In this tutorial, you will learn how to filter your data, including:

* How to use `filter()` to extract observations that pass a logical test
* How to write logical comparisons in R
* How to combine logical comparisons with Boolean operators
* How to handle missing values within comparisons

The readings in this tutorial follow [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), section 5.2. 

### The tutorials that follow

In the two tutorials that follow, you will learn to create new variables and summaries.

To practice these skills, we will use the `flights` data set from the nycflights13 package, which you met in [Data Basics](../01-data-basics/01-data-basics.html). This data frame comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0) and contains all `r format(nrow(nycflights13::flights), big.mark = ",")` flights that departed from New York City in 2013. It is documented in `?flights`.

In these three tutorials, we will use the ggplot2 package that you met in [Data Visualization Basics](../02-data-vis-basics/02-data-vis-basics.html) to visualize the data. 

To manipulate the data, we will use four new functions: `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()`. All work similarly: 

1.  The first argument is a data frame (or tibble).

1.  The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without quotes).
    
1.  The result is a new data frame.

Together these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple function calls to achieve a complex result. Let's dive in and see how these functions work.

I've preloaded the packages for this tutorial with 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr, ggplot2, and others
library(nycflights13)
```

## Filter rows with `filter()`

### filter()

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values. The first argument is the name of the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments are the expressions that filter the data frame. For example, we can select all flights on January 1st with:

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

When you run that line of code, dplyr executes the filtering operation and returns a new data frame. dplyr functions never modify their inputs, so if you want to save the result, you'll need to use the assignment operator, `<-`. 

Rerun the command in the code chunk below, but first arrange to save the output to an object named `jan1`.

```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r filter2-solution}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r filter2-check}
"Good job! You can now see the results by running the name jan1 by itself. Or you can pass `jan1` to a function that takes data frames as input."
```

### ()

R either prints out the results of a command, or saves the the results to a variable. If you want to do both, you can wrap the assignment in parentheses. Wrap the following command in parentheses, i.e. add a `(` to the start of the line and a `)` to the end. Then run the code. What happens?

```{r filter3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25)
```

```{r filter3-solution}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```

```{r filter3-check}
"Very Nice! When you surround an assignment in parentheses, R both assigns the result to the object and prints the result to the screen. You can go ahead and check: an object named `dec25` now exists and it contains the data set that you see printed."
```

## Logical Comparisons

### Comparison operators

To use filtering effectively, you have to know how to select the observations that you want with R's comparison operators. R provides the standard suite of comparisons: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). 

When you're starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to test for equality with `=` instead of `==`. When this happens you'll get an informative error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

### Floating point arithmetic

There's another common problem you might encounter when using `==`: floating point numbers. These results might surprise you! To get a feel for floating point numbers, predict what the code below shoudl return, then click "Run Code." Does everything work as you predict?

```{r floating, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
1/49 * 49 == 1
```

Computers cannot store an infinite number of digits, so they round complex numbers to a number that has a large---but finite---number of digits after the decimal place. As a result, `sqrt(2) ^ 2` is saved as something like `1.99999999999999999999999999`, something close to `2` but not exactly equal. So remember that many numbers that you see on a computer are approximations. Instead of relying on `==`, use `near()`:

```{r}
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)
near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
```

## Boolean operators

### &, |, and !

If you give `filter()` more than one argument, it will combine the arguments with "and": `filter()` will return only the rows that return `TRUE` for every expresssion. You can combine tests in other ways with Boolean operators: `&` is "and", `|` is "or", and `!` is "not". The diagram below shows the complete set of Boolean operations.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "In the figure above, `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each operator selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/transform-logical.png")
```

```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question(" What will the following code return? `filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)`",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December", message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December"),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.", message = "The next section will say a little more about combining tests."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, which you might literally translate into  "finds all flights that departed in November or December". Instead it finds all months that equal the result of `11 | 12`, which is an expression that evaluates to `TRUE`. In a numeric context (like here), `TRUE` becomes one, so this finds all flights in January, not November or December. This is quite confusing! The best solution is to be sure to write oue a _complete_ test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R.

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

2. Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
    filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
    ```

3. As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. Don't use them with `filter()`! You'll learn when you should use them later.

4. Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. You'll learn how to create new variables shortly.

## Missing values

### NA

Missing values can make comparisons tricky in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing or unknown values. `NA`s are "contagious" because almost any operation involving an unknown value (`NA`) will also be unknown (`NA`). For example, can you determine what value these expressions that use missing values shoudl evaluate to? Make a prediction and then click "Submit Answer".

```{r nas, exercise = TRUE, evaluate.exercise = FALSE}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
```

```{r nas-check}
"In every case, R does not have enough information to compute a result. Hence, each result is an unknown value, `NA`."
```

### is.na()

The most confusing result above is this one:

```{r}
NA == NA
```

It's easiest to understand why this is true with a bit more context:

```{r}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
# We don't know!
```

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r}
is.na(x)
```

### filter() and NAs

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Use the code chunks below to find all flights that

1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

    ```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex1-solution}
    filter(flights, arr_delay >= 2)
    ```

1. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)

    ```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex2-solution}
    filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex2-hint">
    **Hint:** This is a good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>

1. Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)

    ```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex3-solution}
    filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex3-hint">
    **Hint:** The `carrier` variable lists the airline that operated each flight. This is another good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>
    
1. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    
    ```{r filterex4, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex4-solution}
    filter(flights, 6 < month, month < 10)
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex4-hint">
    **Hint:** When converted to numbers, July, August, and September become 7, 8, and 9.
    </div>

1. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

    ```{r filterex5, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex5-solution}
    filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay < 0)
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex5-hint">
    **Hint:** Remember that departure and arrival delays are recorded in     _minutes_.
    </div>

1. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
    
    ```{r filterex6, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex6-solution}
    filter(flights, dep_delay > 60, (dep_delay - arr_delay) >= 30)
    ```

    <div id="filterex6-hint">
    **Hint:** The time a plane makes up is `dep_delay - arr_delay`.
    </div>
        
1. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

    ```{r filterex7, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex7-solution}
    filter(flights, dep_time <= 600 | dep_time == 2400)
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex7-hint">
    **Hint:** Don't forget flights thsat left at eactly midnight (`2400`). This is a good case for an "or" operator.
    </div>

### Exercise 2

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. What does it do? Can you use `between()` to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

```{r filterex8, exercise = TRUE}
?between
```

### Exercise 3

How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

```{r filterex9, exercise = TRUE}
    
```
```{r filterex9-solution}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```
    
<div id="filterex7-hint">
**Hint:** This is a good case for `is.na()`.
</div>

```{r filterex9-check}
"Good Job! these look like they might be cancelled flights."
```

### Exercise 4

Why is `NA ^ 0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing?
Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general
rule?  (`NA * 0` is a tricky counterexample!)
    
```{r filterex10, exercise = TRUE}
    
```
