This is a reproducible [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document that 
describes a data analysis project. It proceeds in four sections. First, the 
[setup](#setup) section contains a list of required packages and version 
numbers. Next, the [data](#data) section provides a description of the 
information of interest, which is then analyzed and reported in the 
[results](#results) section. Finally, the [discussion](#discussion) section 
concludes with limitations and broader implications.

## Setup

All data wrangling and analysis is done using the 
[R environment](https://cran.r-project.org) with the help of the 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) and 
[broom](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom) packages.

```{r packages}
## install ggplot2 if not already
if (!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}

## load ggplot2 and print version number
library(ggplot2)
packageVersion("ggplot2")

## install broom if not already
if (!requireNamespace("broom", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("broom")
}

## print broom's version number (namespace will be explicitly qualified later)
packageVersion("broom")
```

## Data

The data set, `mpg`, comes from the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
package.

```{r data}
## preview data set
head(mpg)
```

## Results

An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model was used to estimate highway fuel 
efficiency as a function of engine weight, year, number of cylinders, and 
vehicle class.

```{r m1}
## regression model
m1 <- lm(hwy ~ displ + year + cyl + class, data = mpg)
```

Model fit information is provided below.

```{r fit}
## model fit information
data.frame(
  statistic = row.names(t(broom::glance(m1))), 
  value = sprintf("%.2f", t(broom::glance(m1))), 
  row.names = NULL)
```

And here are the regression coefficients.

```{r}
## view output
broom::tidy(m1)
```

It's clear that vehicle class makes a big difference. A boxplot is provided 
below to visualize this difference.

```{r boxplot}
## plot to visualize relationship between hwy and class
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy, fill = class)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = .6) + 
  geom_jitter(shape = 21, size = 2, alpha = .5) + 
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
    axis.title = element_text(hjust = .95, face = "italic"),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Highway Fuel Efficiency", 
    title = "Highway fuel efficiency by vehicle class", 
    subtitle = "Jittered points overlaying boxplots of fuel efficiency by class")
```

## Discussion

There are some limitations and notable takeaways too.
